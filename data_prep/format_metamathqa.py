#     "content": "Question: Gdańsk (, ; German: \"\" , ) is a Polish city on the Baltic coast. It is the capital of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland's principal seaport and is also the centre of the country's fourth-largest metropolitan area. \n\nThe city lies on the southern edge of Gdańsk Bay (of the Baltic Sea), in a conurbation with the city of Gdynia, spa town of Sopot, and suburban communities, which together form a metropolitan area called the Tricity (\"Trójmiasto\"), with a population approaching 1.4 million. Gdańsk itself has a population of 460,427 (December 2012), making it the largest city in the Pomerania region of Northern Poland. \n\nGdańsk is the capital of Gdańsk Pomerania and the largest city of Kashubia. With its origins as a Polish stronghold erected in the 980s by Mieszko I of Poland, the city's history is complex, with periods of Polish rule, periods of Prussian or German rule, and periods of autonomy or self-rule as a \"free city\". Between the world wars, the Free City of Danzig was in a customs union with Poland and was located between German East Prussia and the so-called Polish Corridor. \n\nGdańsk lies at the mouth of the Motława River, connected to the Leniwka, a branch in the delta of the nearby Vistula River, which drains 60 percent of Poland and connects Gdańsk with the Polish capital, Warsaw. Together with the nearby port of Gdynia, Gdańsk is also an important industrial center. In the late Middle Ages it was an important seaport and shipbuilding town, and in the 14th and 15th centuries a member of the Hanseatic League. 1. Which bay is Gdansk on?\n2.

The shooting sparked days of violent protests in Ferguson as residents demanded his arrest. \n\nSeparate federal and local investigations are under way, and Wilson -- who has received death threats -- has disappeared from public view. \n\nGovernor orders drawdown of National Guard in Ferguson \n\nHere's what is known about his whereabouts. \n\nWhere is he now? \n\nFew outside Wilson's family and authorities know for sure. \n\nWilson owns a house in a modest neighborhood about 20 miles from Ferguson.

Most have shunned reporters' requests for interviews, and some put signs in their yards shooing away journalists. \n\n\"We don't know anything ... Pray for Peace,\" one read, according to the Post-Dispatch. \n\n\"We have 2 children. Do not knock!! No comment,\" another family wrote. \n\nAny trails on social media? \n\nThe newspaper reported that Wilson deactivated his social media accounts before his name went public. \n\nThe only social media presence for him now is from supporters, who have set up Facebook pages to support and raise money for him. \n\n1. unarmed black teen\n2.
